# RagaScript
A programming language that captures the beautiful melodic essence of Carnatic music! 

The language treats code like musical composition, where variables are swaras, functions are ragas with their characteristic arohanam/avarohanam patterns, and you can even add gamakas as decorators to ornament your code. I love how control flow follows ascending/descending musical movement, and how you can improvise with kalpanaswara arrays!
The example program shows how you'd write a simple kriti with pallavi, anupallavi, and charanam sections. It really captures that blend of structure and improvisation that makes Carnatic music so special.
